## Rules
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation. <br>
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. <br>
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. <br>
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. <br>

## How to control
Press Space to add new cells. <br>
Press Delete to delete cells. <br>

You can use GameOfLifeEngine from the project to implement game of life where you want to.
